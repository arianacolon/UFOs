# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Overview
Dana is intrigued by UFO sightings and wants to analyze UFO sighting data with JavaScript by creating a filter table. So far, the index.html we have created allows users to filter sightings by data.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to allow users to search sighting by multiple criteria. Along with date, users can search and filter by city, state, country, and shape of UFO.
## Results
### Image of Search Criteria

The image pictured above displays the initia page before any searches have been completed. The user is allowed to fill as many of the search criterias. After the criteria is entered and the Enter button is pressed, the search will run and the matching results will be presented.
### Search Example

For example, if a user only wanted to view sightings in Florida, the search criteria would be 'fl'. Once entered is pressed, only the sightings for Florida are displayed.
## Summary
### Drawback
One drawback of this webpage is users not being able to filter by duration.
### Recommendations
A recommendation for further development is to allow users to filter the search by duration. A second recommendation is to allow users to search adjective words from the comments, such as "bright." With these two recommendations, it can allow the searches to become even more personalized for the user than it already is.
